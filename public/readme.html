  <h1>Code Runner</h1>
  <p>This project runs user sumbited code in a isolated javascript instance and then shows that result to the user.
    Simply put your varible name and code in the form and press add. If the varible already exists, the button will
    change to modify. You can also hit the buttons to recalculate, modify, or delete varibles. You can also refresh the
    data with the refresh button.<br>
    <br>
    ONLY NUMBERS ARE ALLLOWED IN VARIBLES DUE TO TIME CONTRAINTS<br>
    <br>
    When a varible name is not allowed, it is replaced with noname# where # starts at 1 and increases as to not override
    other nonames. Varibles are cloned when passed to other calculations so varibles can't be modified, though their
    clones can be returned. The code entered is run in eval, so code can be interpreted weirdly. Most notably objects
    are interpreted as a block with labels inside, so: {name:value} => {name: return value;} This can be fixed by
    putting the object in parentheses: ({name:value})
